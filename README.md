# React Router 6 Tutorial Introduction

First Day we used React Router to navigate different pages of the app with Routes, Links and Route Params.

Second Day we used Params, Layout files, NavLinks, NavLinks 'end' attribute, Outlets, Outlet 'context' attribute, relative links and relative paths to further enhance UX and UI.

Third Day we used searchParams hook to make filters, useLocation hook to return back to a filtered page instead of default, * path to make an invalid url page etc.

Fourth day we switched from using the useEffect hook to load our page and used a loader function with the useLoaderData hook.

Learning about more hooks like the useNavigate also redirect, also replacing react form with react router Form and it's action hook and setting up requireAuth component for protecting special routes.
